Deployment:

For deployment to the production environment, consider using a production-ready server like Gunicorn, and you can deploy the application on a platform like Heroku, AWS, or any other hosting provider. Set up appropriate environment variables, configure a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL), and secure the application using HTTPS.
